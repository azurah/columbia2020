    "**Collaborative filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are going to lay the groundwork for a cluster of computational tools that are filed under the names \"statistical modeling\", \"machine learning\", and even \"Artifical Intelligence\". We've seen various learning systems in previous lectures, and today we're going to examine a  so-called **recommender system**. One simple kind of recommendation is said to be  **content-based**. In the case of news, for example, recommended articles could be surfaced if you express interest in one topic or another. Other information about the stories could also be used to produce a ranking -- you might also include the number of \"likes\" or tweets, the publisher, the publication date and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first of three approaches Alex Spangher wrote about in his NYT piece on their [next generation news recommender](https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/building-the-next-new-york-times-recommendation-engine/). The second approach can be implemented without any information about content, and instead relies on how users rate or access content. On Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor, we have ratings that people provide for services. At the Times, we don't really have ratings, but instead we have whether or not someone read an article. **Collaborative filtering** uses patterns in these activities to make recommendations. (We \"filter\" items, recommending just a few, and this is a \"collaborative\" act because it relies on the input of others.)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of collaborative filtering is something called a \"utility matrix\" or \"incidence matrix\". It's a table where rows refer to users (shoppers, readers), say, and columns are items (news articles, consumer goods). A recommendation system \"fills in\" or predicts how the user in row i will react to the object represented by column j -- that is, the table entry (i,j). Oh, math!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here's a cartoon. Let's decide if we are going to recommend a great article on Climate Change to Nina. Nina is represented by row i in the incidence matrix and our Climate Change article is represented by column j. In row i we have 0's and 1's -- a 0 if Nina has not read the article and a 1 if she has. Column j is also filled with 0's and 1's, but this time an entry is 0 if the corresponding reader hasn't selected the article and 1 if he has. Got it? A row refers to the choices by a single user, and a column refers to the choices made by all our users for a single article. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have two possible ways to use our incidence matrix, our table of 0's and 1's, to predict whether Nina will like our Climate Change article. The first is to find readers that are \"similar\" to Nina in terms of reading habits. That is, they have read some of the same articles or have 0's and 1's in the same places across their rows. We can take some number of readers who are most similar to Nina (the number always being called k) and then see what fraction read the article in question. In the image below, the gray band refers to the k readers who are similar to Nina and the red stripe highlights a column representing their reading of the single article. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=https://github.com/computationaljournalism/columbia2018/raw/master/images/abcabc.001.jpeg width=700>\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach to fill in the (i,j) entry of a table like this would be to look at  articles similar to the Climate Change piece we want to recommend to Nina. Articles are similar if they were read (or not) by the same people. We can then take the k most similar articles and see what fraction of them Nina has read. If it's high, we recommend the article to her. The figure below is just the flip of the one we've seen. The grey band is now similar articles to the given one and the red stripe looks at whether or not Nina read these. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=https://github.com/computationaljournalism/columbia2018/raw/master/images/abcabc.002.jpeg width=700>\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems pretty straightforward (I hope). The techniques here are referred to as \"k-nearest neighbors\" (or KNN or kNN). It's actually a pretty powerful machine learning (well, statistical) technique. And we leverage this kind of scheme all the time -- your doctor, for example, distills \"you\" into a row in a table, a height, a weight, a blood pressure, maybe some facts from your medical history. She then gives you advice about dropping a few pounds, say by what the medical profession knows about people like you. The idea is that the health outcomes of people \"similar\" to you can help predict what's around the corner for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key ideas here are pretty fundamental and **they have to do with distance.** (Again.) Rows, for example, can be compared. In the case of collaborative filtering, we can evaluate one reader relative to another, marking some as close (likeminded, similar tastes) and others as far (red state, different tastes). This is a basic, mathematical abstraction that machine learning applies to all tables. Rows are points in a \"high-dimensional space\". (The same is true for columns, of course, except that it's typical to have tables -- spreadsheets-- organized so that rows refer to units of observation and columns refer to their characteristics.)\n",
